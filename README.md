Summary of my Analysis: 
  The data shown is of 15 different schools from 2 different types of schools (district/charter) and showing the passing rate between math and reading and the effect that a school's spending limit ad size would have on the passing rate per student. 

Conclusions: 
  The first conclusion that can be made is that of the subjects themselves. In all 15 Schools no matter if they were district or charter schools it appears that the average passing rate for readding was always higher than the average passing rate for math and inmost cases it was substantially higher. 
  Secondly what i actually found to be most interesting was that when you look at the "per_school_summary" data frame it appears that in most cases the school that had a smaller total budget actually had a closer margin to the reading and math average passing rates. The average students passing math was still lower than reading but the percentage was much closer than teh schools that had much higher total budgets which to me seams backwards.
